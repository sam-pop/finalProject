---

> _In The Loop is a fully responsive, React.js/MongoDB/Mongoose/Node.js/Express/Axios MVC web app that was built in a few days as a full-stack coding project._

**Your friends have all moved, but you just canâ€™t move on...**

In The Loop is a web app designed for users that want to keep-in-touch with people all over the world.

The purpose of this app is to help users keep track / better connect with their remote friends.

A user can input his friends location and the app will display information from where they are such as: current temperature, latest news headlines and a personal note / reminder that the user added to help him remember an event / topic of conversation to follow up on / meaningful event in his friend life.
